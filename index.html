            <p>Hi I am Lesedi, I enjoy reading and writing. I spend most of my time studying.
                I choose to study with BUY Pathway as it allows me to be able to work and study at the same time and most
                importantly the degrees offered are international.
                I hope to encourage others to also join in becuase there are a lot of opportunities. I live in South Africa
                and I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints. I want to become a software developer.
